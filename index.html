  <h1>AZIFA (ETHIOPIAN LENTIL SALAD)</h1>
 <p><strong>Azifa</strong> is an Ethiopian green lentil dish that combines lentils with lime juice, mildly hot peppers, and spices. It has served cold as a light snack and is especially popular during lent when meat is prohibited.</p> <br>

 <p>Since it is entirely vegetarian, most Ethiopian eat this food during the fasting season. Azifa is served as an easy snack with injera or with lettuce and tomatoes, and cottage cheese.</p>
<hr>
<p>Injera is a sour tested fragmented flatbread, and it is made of teff flour. In Ethiopia and Eritrea, it is considered a <em>national dish</em>.</p> <br>

<p>Why is Azifa my favorite food? It is healthy and simple to prepare and packs quite a bit of flavor! Usually, Azifa is prepared with fresh jalapenos, red onions, and lime, which gives the dish a refreshing taste and contrasts the cooked lentils. I like adding other ingredients like cucumber, banana, and red peppers.</p>
